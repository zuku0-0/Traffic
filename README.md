# Traffic
This is a little traffic management game. The player is supposed to click the traffic lights to stop the car, yet the car can only stop on the road crossing closest to the traffic light. Also keep in mind that the lights from the traffic lights are so bright the drivers can't see what's in front of them. This was made on Scratch
